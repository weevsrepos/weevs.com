          <p><b>Weevs®</b> collects personal data to conduct our business, provide and market our services, and meet our
            legal obligations. Likewise, we may also collect personal data for other purposes, which we would describe
            in more detail to you at the point we collect the personal data.</p>
          <p class="mt-32">You may refuse to provide us with some or all of your personal data; however, this may limit the ways in
            which we can interact with you, including providing you with our services.</p>

          <h2>Customer Data</h2>
          <h6>3.1. Rights in Customer Data </h6>
          <p>As between the parties, Customer will retain all right, title and interest (including any and all
            intellectual property rights) in and to the Customer Data as provided to Intercom. Subject to the terms of
            this Agreement, Customer hereby grants to Intercom a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to use,
            copy, store, transmit, modify, create derivative works of and display the Customer Data solely to the extent
            necessary to provide the Services to Customer.</p>

          <h6>3.2. Storage of Customer Data</h6>
          <p>Weevs® does not provide an archiving service. Weevs® agrees only that it will not intentionally delete any
            Customer Data from any Service prior to termination of Customer's applicable Subscription Term. Weevs®
            expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.</p>

          <h6>3.3. Customer Obligations</h6>
          <p class="mb-16">
            <b>a)</b> In General. Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, content and legality of all Customer
            Data. Customer represents and warrants to Intercom that Customer has all necessary rights, consents and
            permissions to collect, share and use all Customer Data as contemplated in this Agreement (including
            granting Intercom the rights in Section 3.1 (Rights in Customer Data)) and that no Customer Data will
            violate or infringe (i) any third party intellectual property, publicity, privacy or other rights, (ii) any
            Laws, or (iii) any terms of service, privacy policies or other agreements governing the Customer Properties
            or Customer's accounts with any Third-Party Platforms. Customer further represents and warrants that all
            Customer Data complies with the AUP. Customer will be fully responsible for any Customer Data submitted to
            the Services by any Person as if it was submitted by Customer.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-16">
            <b>b)</b> No Sensitive Personal Information. Customer specifically agrees not to use the Services to
            collect, store, process or transmit any Sensitive Personal Information. Customer acknowledges that Intercom
            is not a Business Associate or subcontractor (as those terms are defined in HIPAA) or a payment card
            processor and that the Services are neither HIPAA nor PCI DSS compliant. Intercom will have no liability
            under this Agreement for Sensitive Personal Information, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-16">
            <b>c)</b> Compliance with Laws. Customer agrees to comply with all applicable Laws in its use of the
            Services. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer will not engage in any unsolicited
            advertising, marketing, or other activities using the Services, including without limitation any activities
            that violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 or any other anti-spam laws
            and regulations.
          </p>

          <p><b>d)</b> Disclosures on Customer Properties. Customer acknowledges that the Weevs Code causes a unique
            cookie ID to be associated with each Person who accesses the Customer Properties, which cookie ID enables
            Intercom to provide the Services. Customer will include on each Customer Property a link to its privacy
            policy that discloses Customer's use of third party tracking technology to collect data about People as
            described in this Agreement. Customer's privacy policy must disclose how, and for what purposes, the data
            collected through Weevs Code will be used or shared with Intercom as part of the Services. Customer must
            also provide People with clear and comprehensive information about the storing and accessing of cookies or
            other information on the Peoples' devices where such activity occurs in connection with the Services and as
            required by applicable Laws. For clarity, as between Customer and Weevs, Customer will be solely responsible
            for obtaining the necessary clearances, consents and approvals from People under all applicable Laws.</p>

          <h2>Support</h2>
          <p>During the Subscription Term of Use, Weevs will provide end user support in accordance with Weevs’s Support
            Policy.</p>
