        We find people that share the same values that we do as an organization, and empathy is one of our key pillars
        and we use it to gain a deeper understanding of our customers' needs, what drives them and what are the very
        difficult challenges that they face that we can help with.

      <p class="mt-32 body-l--regular">
        Empathy cannot be faked, weaponized or leveraged, we use to keep us in check and remind is that we only exist
        for as long as we listen, understand and wish to give back and contribute, this is practical and in the long run
        the only sustainable way to keep a company like ours in business.
